<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rhodium Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotary Type</li><li>Non Rotatable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rhodium sputtering targets can be categorized into two main types: Rotary type and Non-rotatable type. Rotary type sputtering targets are designed to rotate during the sputtering process, providing a more uniform coating on the substrate. Non-rotatable type targets, on the other hand, remain stationary during sputtering. Each type caters to different market needs and preferences, with rotary type targets being favored for larger scale industrial applications where uniformity is critical, while non-rotatable type targets are more commonly used in smaller scale research and development settings.</p></p>
