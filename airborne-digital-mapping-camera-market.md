<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airborne Digital Mapping Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Array Scanners (Pushbroom)</li><li>Area Arrays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Airborne digital mapping cameras come in two main types: linear array scanners, also known as pushbroom sensors, and area arrays. Linear array scanners capture images by scanning across the Earth's surface in a continuous line, while area arrays capture images all at once in a single snapshot. Linear array scanners are often used for high-resolution mapping and monitoring applications, while area arrays are more commonly used for wide-area surveillance and reconnaissance missions. Both types offer unique advantages and cater to different needs within the airborne mapping market.</p></p>
