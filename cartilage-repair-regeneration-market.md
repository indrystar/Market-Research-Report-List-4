<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cartilage Repair & Regeneration Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cell-Based</li><li>Non-Cell-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cartilage repair and regeneration market can be divided into two main types: cell-based and non-cell-based approaches. In cell-based methods, stem cells or chondrocytes are implanted into the damaged cartilage to promote tissue repair and growth. On the other hand, non-cell-based techniques involve the use of scaffolds, growth factors, or biomaterials to stimulate the body's natural healing process. Both approaches have shown promising results in treating cartilage injuries and degeneration, offering patients new options for restoring joint function and reducing pain.</p></p>
