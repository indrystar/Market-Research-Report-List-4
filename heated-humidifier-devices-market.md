<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heated Humidifier Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stand Alone</li><li>Integrated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heated humidifier devices are available in two main types: stand-alone and integrated. Stand-alone humidifiers are separate devices that can be connected to various types of medical equipment, such as CPAP machines or ventilators. Integrated humidifiers, on the other hand, are built directly into the medical equipment itself, eliminating the need for a separate device. Both types of humidifiers serve the same purpose of adding moisture to the air that is being delivered to the patient, but they differ in terms of their design and how they are used.</p></p>
