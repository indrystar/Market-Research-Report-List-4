<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The GPS Signal Splitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>GPS signal splitters can be classified into two main types: Active and Passive. Active splitters amplify the GPS signal before splitting it, ensuring that the signal strength is maintained even after being divided among multiple devices. Passive splitters, on the other hand, do not amplify the signal and simply redistribute it among connected devices. Active splitters are typically more expensive and are used in applications where signal loss is a concern, while passive splitters are more cost-effective and suitable for simpler setups.</p></p>
