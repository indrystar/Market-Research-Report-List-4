<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled Laboratory Chillers</li><li>Air Cooled Laboratory Chillers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory chillers are essential equipment used to cool down laboratory equipment and samples. Water cooled laboratory chillers use water as a coolant to remove heat from the system, while air cooled laboratory chillers use air for the same purpose. Water cooled chillers are more efficient and quieter compared to air cooled chillers, but they require a constant water source for operation. On the other hand, air cooled chillers are more suitable for smaller laboratories with limited space and resources.</p></p>
