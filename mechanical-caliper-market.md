<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Caliper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Lever</li><li>Vertical Lever</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical calipers come in two main types: horizontal lever and vertical lever. Horizontal lever calipers are designed with a lever that moves horizontally to measure distances. This type is typically used for measuring small objects or precise measurements. Vertical lever calipers, on the other hand, have a lever that moves vertically to take measurements. This type is commonly used for larger objects or industrial applications. Both types of mechanical calipers serve the same purpose of accurately measuring distances but have slight variations in their design and application.</p></p>
