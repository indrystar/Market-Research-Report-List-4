<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glaucoma and Cataract Surgery Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glaucoma Surgery Device</li><li>Cataract Surgery Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glaucoma is a condition that damages the optic nerve in the eye, leading to vision loss. Glaucoma surgery devices are used to lower intraocular pressure and prevent further damage to the optic nerve. Cataracts, on the other hand, cause clouding of the eye's lens and can result in blurry vision. Cataract surgery devices are utilized to remove the cloudy lens and replace it with an artificial one to restore vision. Both markets are focused on providing effective and safe treatment options for individuals suffering from these eye conditions.</p></p>
