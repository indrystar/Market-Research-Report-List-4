<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pelvic Compression Plate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Locked</li><li>Unlocked</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pelvic Compression Plate market consists of two main types: Locked and Unlocked. Locked plates are designed to provide more stability and support by securely fixing the plate to the fractured bone. This type is commonly used in complex fractures or in cases where the bone requires additional strength. Unlocked plates, on the other hand, allow for some degree of movement at the fracture site, which may be beneficial in promoting bone healing and reducing the risk of stress shielding. Both types have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the patient and the nature of the fracture.</p></p>
