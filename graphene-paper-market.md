<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graphene Paper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Graphene Oxide Paper</li><li>Reduced Graphene Oxide Paper</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Graphene Paper is a material that is made of graphene oxide or reduced graphene oxide, both of which are types of graphene-based materials. Graphene oxide paper is a type of graphene paper that is made from graphene oxide, which is easier and cheaper to produce compared to pristine graphene. Reduced graphene oxide paper, on the other hand, is made by reducing graphene oxide to remove oxygen-containing functional groups, resulting in a more conductive and flexible material. Both types of graphene paper have unique properties and applications in various industries.</p></p>
