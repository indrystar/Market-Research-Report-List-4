<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Voltage Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pass Filter</li><li>High Pass Filter</li><li>Band-pass filter</li><li>Band Rejection Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Voltage filters are electronic devices used to pass certain frequencies of an electrical signal while attenuating others. Low pass filters allow low frequencies to pass through, blocking high frequencies. High pass filters do the opposite, allowing high frequencies to pass through while blocking low frequencies. Band-pass filters only allow a specific range of frequencies to pass through, while band rejection filters block a certain range of frequencies while allowing all others to pass. Each filter type is used in different applications where specific frequency ranges need to be controlled.</p></p>
