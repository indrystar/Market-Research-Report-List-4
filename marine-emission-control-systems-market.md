<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Emission Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scrubber</li><li>Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Systems</li><li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Systems</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine Emission Control Systems can be classified into different types based on their technology and functionality. Scrubbers are used to remove pollutants from exhaust gases by spraying them with a water solution. Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Systems reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by recirculating a portion of the exhaust gases back into the engine. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Systems use a catalyst to convert nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and water. Other types of emission control systems may include diesel particulate filters or oxidation catalysts.</p></p>
