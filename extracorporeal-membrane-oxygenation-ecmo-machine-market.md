<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Venoarterial (VA)</li><li>Venovenous (VV)</li><li>Arteriovenous (AV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Machines are used to provide temporary support to patients with severe heart or lung problems. There are three main types of ECMO machines based on the different ways they circulate blood: Venoarterial (VA) ECMO, which provides support for both the heart and lungs; Venovenous (VV) ECMO, which supports only the lungs; and Arteriovenous (AV) ECMO, which is less commonly used and involves drawing blood from an artery and returning it to a vein. Each type is used based on the specific needs of the patient's condition.</p></p>
