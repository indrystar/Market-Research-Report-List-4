<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Personal Radiation Dosimeter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Electronic Personal Radiation Dosimeter</li><li>Passive Electronic Personal Radiation Dosimeter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Active Electronic Personal Radiation Dosimeters are devices worn by workers in radiation-prone environments that continuously monitor and display radiation levels in real-time. They provide immediate feedback to the wearer, allowing them to take necessary precautions to limit exposure. Passive Electronic Personal Radiation Dosimeters, on the other hand, record and store radiation levels for later analysis. They do not provide real-time feedback but are useful for gathering data on cumulative exposure over a period of time. Both types are important tools in ensuring the safety of workers in radiation-heavy industries.</p></p>
