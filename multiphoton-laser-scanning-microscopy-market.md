<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multiphoton Laser Scanning Microscopy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Upright Microscope</li><li>Inverted Microscope</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multiphoton laser scanning microscopy is categorized into two main types based on the design of the microscope: upright microscope and inverted microscope. In upright microscopes, the objective lens is located below the sample, allowing for easy manipulation of thick samples. In contrast, inverted microscopes have the objective lens located above the sample, making them ideal for observing live samples or cells growing in a culture dish. Both types of microscopes are commonly used in scientific research and medical applications for high-resolution imaging and analysis.</p></p>
