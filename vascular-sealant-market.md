<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural/Biological Sealants</li><li>Synthetic Sealants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vascular sealants are used to control bleeding and promote tissue healing during vascular surgeries. There are two main types of vascular sealants: natural/biological sealants and synthetic sealants. Natural sealants are derived from human or animal sources, such as fibrin or collagen, and mimic the body's natural clotting process. Synthetic sealants, on the other hand, are made from artificial materials and provide a more standardized and consistent option for sealing blood vessels. Both types of sealants have their own advantages and are used according to the specific requirements of the surgery.</p></p>
