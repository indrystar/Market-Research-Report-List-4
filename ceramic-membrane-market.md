<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ceramic Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hyperfiltration</li><li>Microfiltration</li><li>Nanofiltration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ceramic membrane market is segmented into three main types: hyperfiltration, microfiltration, and nanofiltration. Hyperfiltration uses high-pressure processes to separate impurities at the molecular level, making it effective for desalination and wastewater treatment. Microfiltration, operating at lower pressures, removes larger particles, bacteria, and suspended solids, often used in beverage and food industries. Nanofiltration bridges the gap between these two, targeting organic compounds and divalent ions, typically employed in water softening and textile applications, enhancing overall filtration efficiency.</p></p>
